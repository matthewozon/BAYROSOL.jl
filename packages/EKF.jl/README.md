# EKF.jl

**EKF** is an implementation of the **E**xtended **K**alman **F**ilter in
Julia.  One of the main objectives of EKF is to solve time varying parameter
estimation problems.

The documentation will come at some point... maybe:

* [Algorithm](doc/algo.md) describes the algorithm implemented in the module;

* [Use](doc/use.md) describes how to use the module and explains what should
be implemented for a specific problem;
